    "Intellectual property can be protected through various legal and strategic measures. Trademarks safeguard brand names, logos, and slogans, ensuring that businesses maintain unique identities. Copyrights protect creative works such as books, music, and software, preventing unauthorized reproduction. Patents grant exclusive rights to inventors, allowing them to control the use of their innovations. Trade secrets, like proprietary formulas or business processes, can be secured through confidentiality measures. Contracts and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) help prevent employees and partners from sharing sensitive information. Digital protections, such as encryption, watermarks, and digital rights management (DRM), help prevent online content theft. Defensive publication can be used to publicly disclose an idea, preventing others from patenting it. Finally, active enforcement through monitoring and legal action ensures that intellectual property rights are upheld against infringement.\n",
