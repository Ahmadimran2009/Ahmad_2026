def classify_age(age):
    if 3 <= age <= 12:
        return "Child"
    elif 13 <= age <= 17:
        return "Teenager"
    else:
        return "Adult"

# Main program for age classification
try:
    # Get user input
    age_input = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
    # Classify and print result
    age_group = classify_age(age_input)
    print(f"You are classified as: {age_group}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number for age.")

```
