A. Designing new technologies intended only for advanced users
B. Designing new technologies to be accessible to individuals with different physical abilities
C. Implementing government regulations restricting citizensâ€™ access to Web content

How would you attempt to fix the digital divide or prevent it from being as prevalent in our community? What are some things that are already being done? What are some things we can add? Explain.

To fix the digital divide, we need to expand internet access, provide affordable devices, and offer digital literacy programs. Many initiatives already work toward this, such as government-funded broadband expansion, nonprofit programs that donate devices, and schools providing students with laptops and Wi-Fi hotspots. However, we can add more community-driven solutions, like local businesses offering free Wi-Fi, libraries hosting digital skills workshops, and tech companies partnering with schools to provide resources. Encouraging policies that lower internet costs and supporting public-private partnerships can also help bridge the gap and ensure equal digital opportunities for everyone.
