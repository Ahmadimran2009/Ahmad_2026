    "a. The length of numList must be even\n",
    "\n",
    "b. The list numList must not contain any duplicate values\n",

    "\n",
    "d. The value of target must not be equal to -1\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is C because the list must be sorted because procedures like binary search use order to decide where to search next. Without sorting, the algorithm can't make correct decisions and may fail.\n",

    "Which of the following statements correctly describes a disadvantage of binary search compared to linear search? Explain why your answer is correct and why the others are wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "a Binary search takes more time on average than linear search  \n",
    "b Binary search cannot be used on unsorted lists without modifications  \n",
    "c Binary search always ret urns the first occurrence of the target  \n",
    "d Binary search can only be used on lists with unique values\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is B because binary search only works properly if the list is sorted. Without sorting, it canâ€™t reliably decide whether to search left or right, which breaks the logic of the search.\n",
