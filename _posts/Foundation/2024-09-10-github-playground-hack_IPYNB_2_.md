# notes I took during panel

Things that got the people into STEM

They liked project-based
How you can take multiple pieces of ideas and put it into a project
Happy to see finished projects
Creating websites
STEM is huge and a very good opportunity

They focus a lot on how your code works, not if it works or not
Very similar to the live reviews
Teacher targets areas of weakness to see improvement

When you go up to a recruiter, you need to know what points you want to talk about and know clearly what you want to show

One very important question that almost every club asks is “Tell me more about yourself,”

Making sure to show your methodology and how you did things is very important which you should do in your issues

Some classes require you to do flowcharts before you start a project

Explore how the user should use your website not just what you are working on

In many companies, you need to know how to use GitHub and it is a really useful tool

Gather all ideas from each person in the group and put them together, making sure each person is organized has a role, and is not off track

College admissions

Do not write the essay the night before

Talk about your social life in the essays

Think about the aspects of the colleges and if they fit with what you want in the future for example schools with a lot of project-based learning

Once you get to college make friends which could help you get jobs and interns

Make sure to show passion and find a specific thing in that college and how you want to make an impact

Take community college courses

Jobs do not look at GPA, they look at your skills, projects, and maybe at the end GPA but it is not that much affected

Building websites helps get good connections.
 
If you have a passion for something, go do something about it because you will have no problem if you truly have a passion for something

Understand league code

Portfolios with a full website are very good and should go on your one-page resume

Go to career fairs if your school has one because you can find lots of connections

# reflection on panel
the Panel was fun and interesting as I learned some very important things that could have a very big impact on my future. not only did I learn about computer science in college I learned what colleges look for and how to decide on a good college for you. for the computer science side of things, I learned that some courses are very similar to Mr Mort's live reviews as Daniel who is in Purdue says that just like how we do live reviews in Mort's class, they also do a very similar thing where they do a solo review with their teacher instead of a group which we do in Mr Mort's class. I also learned that Github is very essential and knowing how to use it is very important for things in the future. On the other side of things I learned that the most important thing is that if you habe a passion for something, go do something about it because you will have no problem if you truly have a passion for somehting. overall, Overall, the panel provided valuable insights and inspiration, reinforcing the importance of passion, preparation, and practical skills for a successful future.

# something I will investigate, do, or change as a result of panelist discussion.
As a result of this insightful panelist discussion, I am inspired to make meaningful changes in my approach to personal and professional growth. I will dedicate time to understanding league code, actively build a network of valuable connections, and focus deeply on pursuing a passion that truly excites me. The most impactful lesson I’ve taken from this discussion is the significance of following your passion. If you genuinely believe in it and commit to it wholeheartedly, success will naturally follow. This mindset has profoundly resonated with me and will guide my future actions.
