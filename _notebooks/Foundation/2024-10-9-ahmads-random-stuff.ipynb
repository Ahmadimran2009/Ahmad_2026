    "The Fridge Feature helps users manage ingredients and discover recipes based on what they have on hand. Users can add ingredients (e.g., \"tomato, mozzarella, basil\") to their virtual fridge, which are stored and linked to their user ID for personalized use. Through various endpoints, users can add ingredients via a POST request, retrieve their stored ingredients with a GET request, or search for recipes that utilize their available items. This functionality simplifies meal planning and reduces waste by making the most of existing ingredients.\n",
