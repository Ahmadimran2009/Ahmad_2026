```python
# Popcorn hack number 2: Classifying fruit ripeness
ripeness = "Ripe"

if ripeness == "Ripe":
    print("The fruit is ready to eat!")
elif ripeness == "Unripe":
    print("The fruit needs more time to ripen.")
elif ripeness == "Overripe":
    print("The fruit is overripe and should be eaten soon.")
else:
    print("Unknown ripeness.")

```

    The fruit is ready to eat!
