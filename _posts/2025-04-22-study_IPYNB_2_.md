```python
def binary_to_decimal(binary_str):
    decimal = 0
    for i in range(len(binary_str)):
        decimal += int(binary_str[-(i + 1)]) * (2 ** i)
    return decimal

#Get user input
binary_input = input("Enter a binary number: ")
decimal_output = binary_to_decimal(binary_input)
print(f"The decimal representation of {binary_input} is {decimal_output}.")

```

    The decimal representation of 1000100 is 68.

# Homework hack

To convert a binary number to decimal, you multiply each bit by 2 raised to its position power (starting from the right at 0) and then add them up.

For 11111111:
Each bit is 1, so you add:
2
7
+
2
6

2
5

=
255

 =128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255

‚úÖ So, 11111111 in binary = 255 in decimal

# Logic gate hacks

# popcorn hack 1

**Q:**  
What are methods of real-world purpose that using logic gates can implement? Explain deeper if using our listed impacts, explaining why this impact is helpful.

**A:**  
Logic gates are used in real-world systems like:

- **Computers and Smartphones:**  
  Logic gates control how computers perform calculations, store memory, and make decisions. Without logic gates, modern devices wouldn‚Äôt work because they need to process millions of logical operations every second.

- **Medical Devices:**  
  Devices like pacemakers use logic gates to monitor and regulate heartbeats. This impact is **life-saving** because it ensures that if the heart‚Äôs rhythm is abnormal, the device automatically corrects it.

- **Traffic Lights:**  
  Traffic light systems use logic gates to change lights based on sensors (like if a car is waiting). This is **helpful** because it improves traffic flow and safety, making streets more efficient and preventing accidents.

- **Security Systems:**  
  Alarm systems use logic gates to activate alarms only when certain conditions (like door open **and** motion detected) are true. This is **helpful** because it increases protection by being accurate ‚Äî not triggering false alarms easily.

**Q:**  
A digital circuit receives three binary inputs: X, Y, and Z. The circuit outputs 1 if and only if X AND Y are both 1, OR Z is 1.

Which expression matches?

**Answer:**  
**A. (X AND Y) OR Z**

**Explanation:**  
- First, if both **X AND Y are 1**, the output should be 1.
- Also, if **Z is 1** (no matter X or Y), the output should be 1.
- That matches **(X AND Y) OR Z**.

# homework hack


```python
def secure_entry_system(keycard, pin, voice_auth):
    def AND(a, b):
        return a & b  # AND logic

    # All three conditions must be true
    return AND(AND(keycard, pin), voice_auth)

# Test cases
print(secure_entry_system(1, 1, 1))  # Expected Output: 1 (Access Granted)
print(secure_entry_system(1, 1, 0))  # Expected Output: 0 (Access Denied)
print(secure_entry_system(1, 0, 1))  # Expected Output: 0 (Access Denied)
print(secure_entry_system(0, 1, 1))  # Expected Output: 0 (Access Denied)

```

    1
    0
    0
    0


Now you must have keycard, pin, and voice authorization all set to 1 to get access (1 = Access Granted).

If any one is missing (0), access is denied.
