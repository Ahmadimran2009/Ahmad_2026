# 3 sentance summary

This code iterates through each row in the data_cleaned DataFrame, extracting the country name and its corresponding "Rate (WB)" value. It then assigns a status of "doing great" if the rate is above 70; otherwise, it assigns "needs improvement". Finally, it prints the country name, rate percentage, and status in a formatted string.

A. Designing new technologies intended only for advanced users
B. Designing new technologies to be accessible to individuals with different physical abilities
C. Implementing government regulations restricting citizensâ€™ access to Web content
D. Having world governments support the construction of network infrastructure

correct answer is B and D because they promote accessibility and inclusivity in technology. B ensures that individuals with different physical abilities can use technology, making it more universally accessible, while D emphasizes the importance of government support in expanding network infrastructure, allowing more people worldwide to connect to the internet. In contrast, A focuses only on advanced users, which limits accessibility, and C restricts web access rather than expanding it.

How would you attempt to fix the digital divide or prevent it from being as prevalent in our community? What are some things that are already being done? What are some things we can add? Explain.

To fix the digital divide, we need to expand internet access, provide affordable devices, and offer digital literacy programs. Many initiatives already work toward this, such as government-funded broadband expansion, nonprofit programs that donate devices, and schools providing students with laptops and Wi-Fi hotspots. However, we can add more community-driven solutions, like local businesses offering free Wi-Fi, libraries hosting digital skills workshops, and tech companies partnering with schools to provide resources. Encouraging policies that lower internet costs and supporting public-private partnerships can also help bridge the gap and ensure equal digital opportunities for everyone.

**DOWNLOAD AND COPY THIS NOTEBOOK TO YOUR PERSONAL REPOSITORY**

Download and extract [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/world-internet-usage-data-2023-updated) dataset from kaggle and move it into the same folder as this notebook.

All the preprocessing has been done for you, and the unneeded columns have been dropped. Your task is to loop through the Rate (WB) column and print the country name associated with the percentage, the percentage, and "doing great" if the percentage is above 70% or "needs improvement" if not above 70%.

For example, 18.4% of people in Afghanistan have access to the internet (According to data from the World Bank), so you would print "Afghanistan: 18.4: Needs improvement"

On the other hand, Albania has 83.1% internet access so you would print "Albania: 83.1%: doing great"
